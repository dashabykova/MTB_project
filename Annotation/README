Annotation.py is a preliminary data processing script. Nucleotide sequences of each protein-coding gene is translated and aligned to the reference protein sequences with extreme care to take into account possible frameshifts, start or stop codon loss, etc. 
The script takes 4 arguments as input: (1) file with nucleotide variants to annotate, (2) folder to write an output file, (3) threshold of mutated gene ORF length: gene is considered to be "broken" if the length of its ORF is below the threshold (0.5 is recommended), (4) folder for temporary files to put into. 

Example of use:
python3 Annotation.py Node11648.variants test/ 0.5 blastx_tempfiles/
